  A century after the introduction of Columbia’s fight song, the University has become not only an institution of academic prestige, but a giant of New York City real estate. The extent of the University’s institutional property holdings has, however, remained largely unclear—until now.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the highest of published estimates, the RealDeal, a news outlet focused on commercial and residential real estate, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/10/20/trd-pro-these-universities-have-the-largest-nyc-real-estate-footprints/">reported</a> in 2022 that the University owned 216 buildings in New York City, totaling 13.9 million square feet in ownership. This estimate earns Columbia the title of the largest private landowner in New York City by number of addresses. Yet, it still underestimates the true size of the University’s real estate portfolio beyond holdings listed under “The Trustees Columbia University.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A Spectator analysis of the New York City Department of City Planning Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output has confirmed that Columbia owns at least 245 properties in New York City, exceeding previous estimates by nearly 30 properties. Confirmed properties have permits under one of at least 31 variations of “The Trustees of Columbia University.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Spectator also accessed a publicly available Accounting and Reporting at Columbia<a href="https://www.finance.columbia.edu/content/arc-site-pivot-tree"> document</a> listed as “ARC Site Pivot Tree” under “Forms & Documents,” which additionally lists at least 383 distinct addresses in New York City under “institutional real estate,” “Baker Field,” “Faculty Practice,” “Morningside Heights,” and “Manhattenville [<i>sic</i>].” “ARC Site Pivot Tree” included no complementary data dictionary. No other document made publicly available under “Forms & Documents” by Columbia Finance defines the nature of the sites and addresses listed on “ARC Site Pivot Tree.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The list from ARC referenced in this article represents site codes to track financial expenses associated with business activity and is therefore a much broader list than Columbia-owned properties,” a University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator on April 27. “While the list contains some Columbia-owned properties, it also includes properties that Columbia leases, as well as properties with no ownership or lease affiliation with the university.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The 245 properties place Columbia far above peer institutions in New York City in terms of the number of properties it owns in the city. New York University and Fordham University <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page">trail behi</a><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page">nd</a> with 119 and 25 properties respectively, according to PLUTO.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The largest of the University’s acquisitions are related to the construction of the Manhattanville campus, a $6 billion development spanning from 125th Street to 134th Street. Fifteen years into construction, University President Lee Bollinger characterized the development as “not even a third” complete in a November interview with Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">

</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  To balance the potential displacement imposed by Bollinger’s keystone campus expansion into Manhattanville, the University collaborated with West Harlem community leaders to create the Community Benefits Agreement, a 50-page document outlining the precise obligations Columbia holds to the neighboring community. These commitments—including $4 million in legal assistance, $20 million in affordable housing, and $76 million in other resources to be administered by the West Harlem Development Corporation—were based on the “Project Site Map” illustrating the physical boundaries of the lot necessary for the new campus. According to the CBA, the University intended on building “approximately 6.8 million square feet of space,” over the document's 25-year plan.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But beyond the immediate bounds of the burgeoning Manhattanville campus, currently the site of the Business School and School of the Arts, Spectator found that the ARC report lists an additional 16 addresses in the neighborhood as either “institutional real estate” or “Manhattenville [<i>sic</i>],” meaning Columbia owns, leases, or has “financial expenses associated with business activity” at these addresses.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[The CBA is] a commitment we have always handled with the utmost seriousness and respect,” a University spokesperson wrote in a previous statement to Spectator. “We have never violated any aspect of the agreement and we are exceedingly proud of all that it has accomplished through our partnership with the WHDC and the communities of Upper Manhattan.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to the ARC reports, Columbia’s “institutional real estate” spans far beyond the communities the University has entered a formal agreement with. Outside of the Manhattanville, Morningside Heights, and Medical School campuses, the University’s lists an additional 239 addresses as “institutional real estate.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As the University continues to acquire institutional real estate and progress toward the CBA’s 6.8 million square foot development goal, some local resident organizations face challenging negotiations with Columbia.

  The Morningside Heights Community Coalition has been locked in a<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2023/04/03/columbia-policy-institute-hosts-discussion-regarding-university-relationship-with-morningside-heights/"> yearslong struggle</a> for affordable housing inclusion within Columbia’s real estate acquisitions—and recent talks have seen little compromise from the University.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Former MHCC president Laura Friedman said she hopes to see improved consideration for local residents in Columbia’s land use decisions. Most recently, the University began converting 611 W. 112th Street into Columbia’s <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2023/02/15/columbia-to-convert-former-hotel-the-maranamay-into-new-undergraduate-dorm/">newest undergraduate residence hall</a> without plans for affordable housing for local residents.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “You know, we’ve been in a lot of fights with Columbia over the years, believe me, you win a few, you lose a lot,” Friedman said.

  <i>Correction: This article has been updated to more accurately reflect the nature of the ARC data. The article’s headline, which previously stated Columbia holds real estate under 184 pseudonyms, has been updated to reflect the uncertainty of the relationship between the University and the names associated with addresses listed in the ARC report as “institutional real estate,” in addition to “Baker Field,” “Faculty Practice,” “Morningside Heights,” and “Manhattenville [sic].” Additionally, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that PLUTO lists 263 properties under 33 variations of “Trustees of Columbia.” The article has been updated to say PLUTO lists 245 properties under 31 variations of “Trustees of Columbia.” The original number included properties under the name “Columbia Presbyterian” and “Teacher’s College of Columbia University.” This article initially included a property listed as 17 Smith Street as a listing of institutional real estate in New York City; the updated article removed 17 Smith Street after Spectator received information suggesting the address listed refers to a 17 Smith Street in Englewood, New Jersey. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Columbia has over 250 more property claims than New York University. Columbia has at least 245 properties in New York City, compared to New York University’s 119, according to PLUTO. A previous version of the article contained a graphic that worked under the premise that the sites listed in the ARC Site Pivot Tree were property holdings (including partial leases of buildings). Spectator removed this graphic. Spectator regrets this error.</i>
