A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Columbia has over 250 more property claims than New York University. Columbia has at least 245 properties in New York City, compared to New York University’s 119, according to PLUTO. A previous version of the article contained a graphic that worked under the premise that the sites listed in the ARC Site Pivot Tree were property holdings (including partial leases of buildings).
